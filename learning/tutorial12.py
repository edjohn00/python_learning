#CLASSES & OBJECT 
"""
    Onject Oriented Programming - it aims to implement real world object / entities its attributes and behavior into programming so that we can replsent it in our game, software or applications.

    Objects - anything that has an attribute and a purpose is an object.
        example:
        * Game Characters
        * Real Life People (Student, Employees)
        * Real Life Objects (Fruits, Table)

    Class - used in programming to make a blueprint for our object. It will represent their attribute and purpose
        example:
            * Game Characters
                * Purpose
                    * Physical Attack
                    * Magic Attack
                * Attributes
                    * NAME
                    * HP
                    * MP
